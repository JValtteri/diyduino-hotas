#### Description

This is the program to run on Arduino [model] to handle physical inputs.
The program sends the inputs as serial messages. A separate "driver" is required on the PC to read the inputs and translate them in to generic HMI device inputs (keyboard and controller)

#### Notes
- Add support for ilumination LEDs
  - Brightness control by PWM
